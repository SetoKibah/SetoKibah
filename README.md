# :wave: Hello, I'm Bradley!

- :books: I'm a self-taught programmer, started in December of 2020. I have a huge interest in automation in its various forms. 
   - Most recently, I've been experimenting with algorithmic trading and working with API's, as well as developing my own machine learning projects and data science components.
   - I also have an interest in augmenting my daily life, be it by automation of tedious tasks, or supplementing others with additional daily data, macros, etc.

- :chess_pawn: Iâ€™m currently learning R, CSS, Javascript, and always more Python.
  - In particular, I'm focusing on data analysis more recently, and in different techniques for webscraping, data parsing, database management, and sanitizing for security.
  - My checklist of goals I'm working toward are below.
    - [x] Be comfortable with Python.
    - [x] Be comfortable with Javascript.
    - [x] Have a working knowledge of R.
    - [ ] Get a personal website running.
    - [x] Have a positive trading algorithim.
    - [ ] Be comfortable creating a GUI.
    - [ ] Create a mobile application.
    - [x] Learn Arduino.
    - [x] Get a Raspberry Pi running a 24/7 process.
    - [ ] Get a job in tech.

- :technologist: Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that fit my interest, especially if it's something that I can learn something new from!
  - I feel most comfortable in finding issues in Python and C/C++, but I'd be open to learning a new language for a project too.
- ðŸ“« I use the following platforms and can be reached at any time!
